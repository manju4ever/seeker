### This document would briefly explains the problem of the modern BI tooling landscape, high level implementation details, user personas, tools/frameworks/libraries to be used to build a self-serviceable BI tool. 

### Objective

Design a self-servicable Business Intelligence (BI) tool to support exploration, and visualiztion of enterprise level datasets. The solution should be highly robust, scalable, maintainable and high performing.


### The problem of multiple data sources and multiple data models

* The most challenging part of today's BI world is the ability to form a common dialect out of a variety of infromation storage systems. These systems can range from a simple file system to complex RDBMS based, document based, or object based data storage systems. 

### The need for a specialized Domain Specific Language (DSL) to tackle multiple formats of data

* The creation of DSL for applications in general seems to be increasing over the past few years. These DSL(s) can be seen in areas such as Oceanography, Meteorology, Quantum Computing, and many other fileds to provide an open format to process complex instructions behind the screens.
